As in northern Cascadia, the downdip LFE families have recurrence intervals several times smaller than the updip families. For the April 2008 Episodic Tremor and Slip event, the best recorded LFE families exhibit a strong tidal Coulomb stress sensitivity starting 1.5 days after the rupture front passes by each LFE family. The southernmost LFE family, which has been interpreted to be on the subduction plate boundary, near the updip limit of tremor, has a very short recurrence time. Also, these LFEs tend to occur during times when predicted tidal Coulomb stress is discouraging slip on the plate boundary. Both observations suggest that this LFE family may be on a different fault.","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"key":"zQBOxTmrx3"}],"key":"D68I6rBRKq"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":19,"column":1},"end":{"line":19,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Catalog
