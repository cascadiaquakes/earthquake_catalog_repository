(2013)","lvl2":"Abstract"},"content":"We employ 130 low-frequency earthquake (LFE) templates representing tremor sources on the plate boundary below southern Vancouver Island to examine LFE magnitudes. Each template is assembled from hundreds to thousands of individual LFEs, representing over 269,000 independent detections from major episodic-tremor-and-slip (ETS) events between 2003 and 2013. Template displacement waveforms for direct P and S waves at near epicentral distances are remarkably simple at many stations, approaching the zero-phase, single pulse expected for a point dislocation source in a homogeneous medium. High spatiotemporal precision of template match-filtered detections facilitates precise alignment of individual LFE detections and analysis of waveforms. Upon correction for 1-D geometrical spreading, attenuation, free surface magnification and radiation pattern, we solve a large, sparse linear system for 3-D path corrections and LFE magnitudes for all detections corresponding to a single-ETS template. The spatiotemporal distribution of magnitudes indicates that typically half the total moment release occurs within the first 12–24 h of LFE activity during an ETS episode when tidal sensitivity is low. The remainder is released in bursts over several days, particularly as spatially extensive rapid tremor reversals (RTRs), during which tidal sensitivity is high. RTRs are characterized by large-magnitude LFEs and are most strongly expressed in the updip portions of the ETS transition zone and less organized at downdip levels. LFE magnitude-frequency relations are better described by power law than exponential distributions although they exhibit very high b values ≥∼5. We examine LFE moment-duration scaling by generating templates using detections for limiting magnitude ranges (MW<1.5, MW≥2.0). LFE duration displays a weaker dependence upon moment than expected for self-similarity, suggesting that LFE asperities are limited in fault dimension and that moment variation is dominated by slip. This behavior implies that LFEs exhibit a scaling distinct from both large-scale slow earthquakes and regular seismicity.","type":"content","url":"/bostock-jgr-2015#abstract","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Bostock et al.

Mount St. Helens in\nWashington, USA, is the most active volcano in the continental United States\nand has been in quiescence since 2008. To explore the processes driving\nseismicity at Mount St. Helens, we create a high-resolution seismicity catalog of non-\neruptive seismicity from 2008 through 2023, consisting of 31,133 events. We find\npersistent shallow seismicity (-2.2 to 2 km below sea level (BSL), 0 to 4.2 km below the surface)\nthroughout the entire study period that concentrates beneath the dacite dome complex from the\n1980 –1986 and 2004 –2008 eruptions. Additionally, there is frequent deeper seismicity (2 to 8 km\nBSL, 4.2 to 12.2 km below the surface) beginning in 2016. We\nexamine a selection of deep earthquake swarms and find complex along-depth seismicity\npatterns. Within swarms, increases in shallow seismicity rates can precede or are\nconcurrent with increases of deep seismicity rates. Lastly, we discover a series of semi-\nperiodic, shallow, burst-like swarms, consisting of low-amplitude, repetitive similar\nearthquakes, indicating periodic valve-like release of fluid pressure from the conduit.\nIncreased seismic activity beginning in 2016 indicates ongoing repressurization within\nthe magmatic system driven by recharge or crystallization-induced second boiling within\nthe upper-crustal reservoir after 2008. The data indicate that non-eruptive\nseismicity at Mount St. Helens is controlled by fluid pressure changes from gas\nflux sourced from the magma reservoir that migrates through crack networks.","type":"content","url":"/hirao-jgr-2025#abstract","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Hirao et al.

The distribution and characteristics of small- to moderate-sized earthquakes can be used to determine the behavior of the megathrust fault but are notably absent offshore the CSZ due to the distance from onshore seismometers. We use automated subspace detection coupled with an onshore-offshore seismic deployment to find small-magnitude earthquakes in the offshore seismogenic zone and analyze their locations in the context of interseismic locking and seismogenic zone extent. We detected and located 5,282 earthquakes, 4,096 of which had been previously undetected. We find that the downdip extent of the seismogenic zone as defined by interplate seismicity agrees with the 20% locking contour of the Schmalzle et al. (2014, \n\nSchmalzle et al.

We cannot determine the updip extent of the seismogenic zone; this may be due to a lack of templates for detection in the updip source area, stress shadows updip of asperity loading, and/or strong locking to the trench. We present a map of possible asperities determined by the small earthquakes in this study. Our asperity locations and extents show some, but not complete, agreement with the asperities modeled from the 1700 M9 rupture and geodetic locking models, and good agreement with the paleo-rupture extents determined from offshore turbidites and forearc basin-based asperity estimates. This highlights the need of continued offshore observations over time, and to elucidate fine-scale variation in locking.","type":"content","url":"/morton-jgr-2023#abstract","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Morton et al.

We then relocate LFE sources together with regional seismicity. We find that LFE hypocenters form a northeast-dipping alignment at 22–29 km depth, extending eastward from a zone of micro-earthquakes, ∼15 km south of the southern edge of Gorda slab seismicity.

Epicenters are color-coded by depth; depth color scale saturates at 40 km to allow comparison of events to plate contours. Contours show depth of the Juan de Fuca plate at 10, 20, and 30 km (McCrory et al., 2012). The grey dots are historical epicenters recorded in land-based catalogs (PNSN, CNSN, and NCSN), with the majority of historical event coming from the 1970–2015 time range. Also labeled on the map are the Queen Charlotte triple junction (QCTJ), the Mendocino triple junction (MTJ), Vancouver Island (VI), and Newport, Oregon (NP, hollow dot shows city location).

(2018)","lvl2":"Abstract"},"content":"We present a catalog of offshore seismicity generated from Cascadia Initiative (CI) ocean-bottom seismometer data. Earthquakes were detected within the CI data using a short-time-average/long-time-average trigger and located using 1-D velocity models developed from seismic reflection/refraction surveys. The catalog, which contains 271 earthquakes with magnitude 0.4–4.0 along the coasts of Vancouver Island, Washington, Oregon, and Northern California, spans all 4 years of the ocean bottom seismometer deployment and shows distinct along-strike variations in seismicity consistent with structural observations from recent active source seismic reflection/refraction studies. Seismicity is sparse off Vancouver Island and Washington (49°N–46°N) but increases off northern and central Oregon, corresponding to a roughened, more deformed subducting slab. Widespread earthquakes are observed at near-interface depths between 46°N and 45°N, though an increase in underthrust sediment thickness between 45°N and 43°N likely restricts seismicity to scattered asperities on the plate interface. South of 43°N, where both the overriding and subducting plates are severely deformed approaching the Mendocino triple junction, seismicity is abundant. We locate an additional 440 events in the Juan de Fuca plate seaward of the deformation front. The higher seismicity south of 46°N is consistent with more extensive intraplate deformation. Along with the complex stress field induced by the Mendocino triple junction, our observations imply that the smoothness and degree of hydration of the incoming plate, which are linked to the amount of underthrust sediment and extent of intraplate deformation, are major contributing factors to the distribution of microseismicity in the Cascadia subduction zone.","type":"content","url":"/stone-jgr-2018#abstract","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Stone et al.
