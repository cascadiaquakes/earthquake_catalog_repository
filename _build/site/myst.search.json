Although the region hosts abundant seismicity, it has received relatively scant attention in recent years due to its remote, offshore location. We use the Regressive ESTimator (REST) algorithm to generate a new catalog of automatically detected earthquakes from 1995 to 2021, which, when merged with the existing Geological Survey of Canada catalog, yields the most extensive seismicity data set offshore British Columbia to date. We apply double-difference relocation to these events and perform stress inversions using moment tensors for subregions within the study area. Our results confirm and extend previous models of microplate deformation processes. We suggest the Revere-Dellwood-Queen Charlotte fault system has evolved as a NW-migrating, pull-apart system between Haida Gwaii and the Explorer ridge that obeys global length/width scaling and whose bathymetric expression is influenced by volcanism plausibly induced by interaction with the Kodiak-Bowie hotspot. Seismicity within the Explorer microplate is dominated by prominent, northeast-trending lineations that emanate from the Sovanco fracture zone and parallel the Nootka fault zone. Alignment of these features with spreading structures that bound the microplate suggests that its breakup is controlled primarily by a strength fabric inherited at spreading ridges. Stress inversions are dominated by near-vertical intermediate compressive stress reflecting the dominance of strike-slip faulting. Stress varies systematically between transpression to the north along southern Haida Gwaii and seafloor spreading to the south along the Juan de Fuca ridge.","type":"content","url":"/littel-tectonics-2023#abstract","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Littel et al.

To investigate the geometry and temporal behavior of this tremor, we examine its constituent low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) by developing 27 stacked LFE waveform templates that we use to detect events from 2018 to 2024. We then relocate LFE sources together with regional seismicity. We find that LFE hypocenters form a northeast-dipping alignment at 22–29 km depth, extending eastward from a zone of micro-earthquakes, ∼15 km south of the southern edge of Gorda slab seismicity. These LFE families exhibit small bursts of activity every few days. Considering the strong world-wide association of tremor and LFEs with high slip-rate, plate-bounding faults, we hypothesize these LFEs may demark the southern edge of Cascadia subduction.","type":"content","url":"/shelly-grl-2025#abstract","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Shelly et al.

Earthquakes were detected within the CI data using a short-time-average/long-time-average trigger and located using 1-D velocity models developed from seismic reflection/refraction surveys. The catalog, which contains 271 earthquakes with magnitude 0.4–4.0 along the coasts of Vancouver Island, Washington, Oregon, and Northern California, spans all 4 years of the ocean bottom seismometer deployment and shows distinct along-strike variations in seismicity consistent with structural observations from recent active source seismic reflection/refraction studies. Seismicity is sparse off Vancouver Island and Washington (49°N–46°N) but increases off northern and central Oregon, corresponding to a roughened, more deformed subducting slab. Widespread earthquakes are observed at near-interface depths between 46°N and 45°N, though an increase in underthrust sediment thickness between 45°N and 43°N likely restricts seismicity to scattered asperities on the plate interface. South of 43°N, where both the overriding and subducting plates are severely deformed approaching the Mendocino triple junction, seismicity is abundant. We locate an additional 440 events in the Juan de Fuca plate seaward of the deformation front. The higher seismicity south of 46°N is consistent with more extensive intraplate deformation. Along with the complex stress field induced by the Mendocino triple junction, our observations imply that the smoothness and degree of hydration of the incoming plate, which are linked to the amount of underthrust sediment and extent of intraplate deformation, are major contributing factors to the distribution of microseismicity in the Cascadia subduction zone.","type":"content","url":"/stone-jgr-2018#abstract","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Stone et al.
