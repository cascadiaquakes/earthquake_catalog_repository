# Catalog Contribution Instructions

## Requirements

To contribute your earthquake catalog model to CRESCENT:

- **Study Area Requirement**: The majority of the catalog must fall within the CRESCENT geographic footprint (latitude: 39° to 52°, longitude: -130° to -116°) or be completely contained in it.  If you publish a catalog that encompasses a larger region, you are welcome to submit a subset of the catalog that falls within this range.
- **Peer-reviewed**: All models must be published in a peer-reviewed journal with an associated doi.

If your model meets the requirements listed above please follow the steps in the model contribution section below.

## Model Contribution

To contribute your model to the CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository, please follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Prepare your catalog

Your catalog can be submitted as a comma separated variable file with a single header row.  The header fields must be one of the following fields defined below.

Required Fields:

- **LON:** Longitude
- **LAT:** Latitude
- **DEPTH^*:** Latitude
- **YEAR**: Origin Time Year in GMT
- **MONTH**: Origin Time Month in GMT
- **DAY**: Origin Time Day in GMT
- **HOUR**: Origin Time Hour in GMT
- **MINUTE**: Origin Time Minute in GMT
- **SECOND**: Origin Time Second in GMT

Optional Fields:

- **MAG:** Local Magnitude

Each row in the catalog should correspond to a different earthquake.

## Step 2: Prepare a Markdown file describing your catalog

Each earthquake catalog included in the CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository has a corresponding page in the JupyterBook describing CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository (e.g. the Shelly et al. (2025)).  

## Step 3: Submit Your catalog

- **Submission Request**: Visit the <a href="https://github.com/cascadiaquakes/CRESCENT-CVM/issues" target="_blank">CRESCENT-CVM GitHub Issue Page</a> and create a submission request.
  - Your request **must include a download link** to your model.
  - **Do not attach model files** directly to the issue request.
