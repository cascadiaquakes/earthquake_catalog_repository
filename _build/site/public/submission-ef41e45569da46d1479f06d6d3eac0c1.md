# Catalog Contribution Instructions

## Requirements

To contribute your earthquake catalog model to CRESCENT:

- **Study Area Requirement**: The majority of the catalog must fall within the CRESCENT geographic footprint (latitude: 39° to 52°, longitude: -130° to -116°) or be completely contained in it.  If you publish a catalog that encompasses a larger region, you are welcome to submit a subset of the catalog that falls within this range.
- **Peer-reviewed**: All models must be published in a peer-reviewed journal with an associated doi.
