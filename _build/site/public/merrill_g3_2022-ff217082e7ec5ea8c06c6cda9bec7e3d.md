Map of northern Vancouver Island and the Nootka Fault zone region. (a) Relocated earthquakes and anthropogenic events are displayed as black dots and magenta dots, respectively. The green shaded region encloses the interpreted extent of the NFZ. Stations are plotted as inverted red triangles and profiles BB’ through GG' as orange lines. Hypocenter and CMT solutions for the 2004, 2011, and 2014 Mw > 6 events are displayed as the enlarged circles and diamonds, respectively. (b) Zoomed map of the offshore NFZ with relocated earthquake hypocenters colored by depth. Conjugate fault “E3” as defined by Hutchinson et al. (2019) is labeled and the Mw > 6 events are identified as stars.

## Overview

This catalog accompanies **Littel et al. (2024)** and provides a high-resolution earthquake relocation dataset for the **Queen Charlotte Triple Junction (QCTJ)** region. The catalog improves earthquake hypocenter locations using relative relocation techniques, enabling more detailed analysis of fault geometry, seismicity patterns, and tectonic processes at the transition between the Pacific–North America plate boundary systems.

The relocated events illuminate fine-scale seismic structure in a complex tectonic setting that includes strike-slip faulting, subduction, and transform motion.

## Catalog Summary

- **Time span:** XXXX
- **Number of events:** **18,442 earthquakes**  
- **Detection Method:** REST  
- **Association Method:** REST  
- **Location Method:** HypoDD
