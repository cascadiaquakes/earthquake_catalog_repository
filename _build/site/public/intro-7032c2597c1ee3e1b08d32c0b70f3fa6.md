# CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository

The **CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository** is a community resource for the collection, documentation, and dissemination of peer-reviewed earthquake catalogs within the Cascadia Subduction Zone and surrounding regions. The repository is designed to support reproducible earthquake science by providing standardized access to curated catalogs derived using a wide range of detection, association, and location methodologies.

This effort is part of the broader mission of the **Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center (CRESCENT)** to advance understanding of earthquake science in the Pacific Northwest through open science, community model development, and shared cyberinfrastructure.

## Motivation

Earthquake catalogs are foundational datasets for studies of seismicity, fault mechanics, slow slip, tremor, earthquake triggering, and seismic hazard. Over the past decade, advances in data-driven methods—-including machine learning for phase identification, picking, and association, template matching, and increasingly dense seismic instrumentation such as nodal arrays and distributed acoustic sensing—-have enabled the development of high-resolution, regionally focused earthquake catalogs that complement traditional network catalogs.

However, these catalogs are often:
- Distributed across individual publications and/or repositories,
- Produced using heterogeneous formats, conventions, and metadata,
- Difficult to discover, compare, or reuse.

The CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository addresses these challenges by providing:
- A centralized, openly accessible collection of peer-reviewed catalogs,
- Consistent documentation describing how each catalog was generated, and
- A visualization tool that permits catalog comparison in 2D and 3D, interaction, and download in standardized formats.

## Scope

The repository houses earthquake catalogs that:
- Are primarily located within the **CRESCENT geographic footprint** (Cascadia), and
- Have been described in **peer-reviewed publications** with an associated DOI.

Both conventional and non-traditional catalogs are welcome, including those based on:
- Template matching,
- Machine learning detection and phase picking,
- Dense array or nodal deployments,
- Studies of low-frequency earthquakes, tremor, volcano seismicity, or microseismicity.

## Repository Structure

Each catalog included in the repository consists of:
1. A downloadable catalog file (CSV or GeoJSON), and  
2. A corresponding **JupyterBook page** describing the catalog, publication DOI, methods, and scientific context.

Catalog description pages follow a standardized Markdown format to ensure clarity and consistency while allowing contributors to highlight the unique aspects of their work.

## Visualization

Catalogs hosted in this repository are integrated into the **CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Viewer**, enabling interactive exploration of seismicity patterns in space and time. The viewer is intended as a discovery and comparison tool and does not replace citation of the original peer-reviewed publications.

## Authorship and Governance

The CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository is developed and maintained by the CRESCENT cyberinfrastructure team in collaboration with the broader Cascadia earthquake science community. Individual catalogs remain the intellectual property of their original authors.
