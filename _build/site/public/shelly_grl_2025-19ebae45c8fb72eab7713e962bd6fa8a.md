Relocated low-frequency earthquake (LFE) families and microseismicity. Microseismicity is from 01 January 2015 to 11 October 2024 (see Methods). LFEs are shown by white-outlined diamonds. Other seismicity shown by dots, color-coded by depth. Bold black line indicates the coastline. (a) Map view. Dashed box A-A’ indicates the area of the cross section plotted in part (c). P-wave velocity (Vp) depth slice at 27.25 km depth (near the mean LFE depth) from Furlong et al. (2024). Note that LFEs and microseismicity occur along a pronounced velocity contrast, tracking the southern boundary of the low-velocity (low-V) channel. Previously proposed edges of the Gorda slab are shown by light green dashed lines, labeled (from north to south) as Furlong (Furlong et al., 2024), Beaudoin (Beaudoin et al., 1998), McCrory (McCrory et al., 2006), and Jachens (Jachens & Griscom, 1983). The interpreted southern edge of Gorda slab seismicity is indicated by the slightly curved white dotted line. Velocity scale is truncated to emphasize relevant features. (b) West-east cross section, showing all events. (c) Cross section view along the line A-A (oriented along an azimuth of 20°), showing the dipping alignment of LFEs on the eastern edge of a zone of microseismicity. Seismicity is plotted from within the 30-km-wide dashed box in panel (a). (d) Three-dimensional view from the east-southeast (from azimuth 112° and elevation 22°), showing the gap in seismicity between LFEs and Gorda slab seismicity to the north.

## Overview

This catalog accompanies **Littel et al. (2024)** and provides a high-resolution earthquake relocation dataset for the **Queen Charlotte Triple Junction (QCTJ)** region. The catalog improves earthquake hypocenter locations using relative relocation techniques, enabling more detailed analysis of fault geometry, seismicity patterns, and tectonic processes at the transition between the Pacific–North America plate boundary systems.

The relocated events illuminate fine-scale seismic structure in a complex tectonic setting that includes strike-slip faulting, subduction, and transform motion.

## Catalog Summary

- **Time span:** As reported in Littel et al. (2024)  
- **Number of events:** **18,442 earthquakes**  
- **Detection Method:** REST  
- **Association Method:** REST
