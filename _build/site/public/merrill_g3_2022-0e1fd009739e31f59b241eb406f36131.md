Map of northern Vancouver Island and the Nootka Fault zone region. (a) Relocated earthquakes and anthropogenic events are displayed as black dots and magenta dots, respectively. The green shaded region encloses the interpreted extent of the NFZ. Stations are plotted as inverted red triangles and profiles BB’ through GG' as orange lines. Hypocenter and CMT solutions for the 2004, 2011, and 2014 Mw > 6 events are displayed as the enlarged circles and diamonds, respectively. (b) Zoomed map of the offshore NFZ with relocated earthquake hypocenters colored by depth. Conjugate fault “E3” as defined by Hutchinson et al. (2019) is labeled and the Mw > 6 events are identified as stars.

## Overview

This study examines low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) and tectonic tremor along the Cascadia subduction zone using template-matching techniques applied to continuous seismic data. The detected LFEs occur near the plate interface at depths below the locked megathrust and exhibit highly repeatable waveforms, indicating persistent source regions and stable failure processes.
<br />
The spatial and temporal patterns of LFE activity closely track tremor and slow slip, revealing along-strike variability in fault properties and stress conditions beneath Cascadia. These observations highlight the value of LFEs as indicators of deep slow fault slip and provide important constraints on the physical mechanisms governing subduction zone deformation.
