# Catalog Contribution Instructions

## Requirements

To contribute your earthquake catalog model to to the CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Viewer please first make sure your catalog meets the following two requirements:

- **Study Area Requirement**: The majority (>50%) of events in the catalog must fall within the CRESCENT geographic footprint (latitude: 39° to 52°, longitude: -130° to -116°) or be completely contained in it.  If you publish a catalog that encompasses a larger region, you are welcome to submit a subset of the catalog that falls within this range.
- **Peer-reviewed**: All catalogss must be published in a peer-reviewed journal with an associated DOI.

If your earthquake catalog meets the requirements listed above please follow the steps in the catalog contribution section below.

## Catalog Metadata

To contribute your catalog to the CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository, please follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Prepare your catalog

Your catalog can be submitted as a comma-separated values (CSV) file with a single header row.  The header fields must be one of the following fields defined below.

### Required Fields:

- **LON:** Longitude
- **LAT:** Latitude
- **DEPTH:** Depth (km, positive downward)
- **YEAR**: Origin Time Year in GMT
- **MONTH**: Origin Time Month in GMT
- **DAY**: Origin Time Day in GMT
- **HOUR**: Origin Time Hour in GMT
- **MINUTE**: Origin Time Minute in GMT
- **SECOND**: Origin Time Second in GMT

### Optional Fields:

- **MAG:** Local magnitude (e.g., ML), if available
- **STRIKE:** Fault strike (degrees clockwise from North)
- **DIP:** Fault dip (degrees from horizontal)
- **RAKE:** Slip rake (degrees, Aki & Richards convention)
- **M$_{0}$:** Scalar seismic moment (N·m)

Moment tensor components are provided in units of N·m and defined in a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system (commonly 
x=East, y= North, z= Up; users should confirm the convention used). The moment tensor is symmetric.

- **M<sub>xx</sub>:**  Normal component in the x-direction (extension or compression along x)
- **M<sub>yy</sub>:**  Normal component in the y-direction (extension or compression along y)
- **M<sub>zz</sub>:**  Normal component in the z-direction (vertical extension or compression)
- **M<sub>xy</sub>:**  Shear component acting in the x-direction on planes normal to y
- **M<sub>xz</sub>:**  Shear component acting in the x-direction on planes normal to z
- **M<sub>yz</sub>:**  Shear component acting in the y-direction on planes normal to z

Each row in the catalog should correspond to a different earthquake.

## Step 2: Prepare a Markdown file describing your catalog

Each earthquake catalog included in the CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository has a corresponding page describing the catalog in the CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository JupyterBook.  For example, the page describing the LFE catalog of Shelly et al. (2025) can be found <a href="https://cascadiaquakes.github.io/earthquake_catalog_repository/shelly-grl-2025/" target="_blank">here</a>.  

### Descriptive Metadata

To create a JupyterBook page for your catalog you will need to define the following descriptive metadata fields.

- **REGION:** Region spanned by the catalog (e.g., the Blanco transform, Mt. St. Helens)
- **TIME SPAN:** Time period spanned by the catalog
- **NUMBER OF EVENTS:** Total number of events in the catalog 
- **DETECTION METHOD:** Detection method, possibilities include STA/LTA (https://doi.org/10.1785/BSSA0680051521), PhaseNet (https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggy423)
- **ASSOCIATION METHOD:** Association method, possibilities include PyOcto (https://doi.org/10.26443/seismica.v3i1.1130) 
- **LOCATION METHOD:** {method e.g. HypoInverse+HypoDD}  
- **VELOCITY MODEL:** {velocity model name + citation}  

### Catalog Page Template

To create a JupyterBook page describing your catalog please use the following template.

## Step 3: Submit your catalog to the repository

- **Submission Request**: Visit the <a href="https://github.com/cascadiaquakes/cascadia-earthquake-viewer/issues" target="_blank">CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Viewer Issue Page</a> and create a submission request.
  - Your request must include a download link to the CSV file containing your catalog.  Attachments are not permitted.
  - Your request must include a download link to your markdown file containing your catalog description.  
  - Your request must include your contact information so we can get in touch if we have questions and notify you once your catalog is included in the viewer.
