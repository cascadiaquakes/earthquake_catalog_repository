# CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository

The **CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository** is a community resource for the collection, documentation, and dissemination of peer-reviewed earthquake catalogs within the Cascadia Subduction Zone and surrounding regions. The repository is designed to support reproducible earthquake science by providing standardized access to curated catalogs derived using a wide range of detection, association, and location methodologies.

This effort is part of the broader mission of the **Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center (CRESCENT)** to advance understanding of earthquake processes and hazards in the Pacific Northwest through open science, community models, and shared cyberinfrastructure.

## Motivation

Earthquake catalogs are foundational datasets for studies of seismicity, fault mechanics, slow slip, tremor, earthquake triggering, and seismic hazard. Over the past decade, advances in machine learning, template matching, and dense seismic instrumentation have led to the development of many high-resolution, regionally focused catalogs that complement traditional network catalogs.

However, these catalogs are often:
- Distributed across individual publications or repositories,
- Produced using heterogeneous formats and conventions, and
- Difficult to discover, compare, or reuse.

The CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository addresses these challenges by providing:
- A centralized, openly accessible collection of peer-reviewed catalogs,
- Consistent documentation describing how each catalog was generated, and
- Direct links between catalogs, publications, and visualization tools.

## Scope

The repository focuses on earthquake catalogs that:
- Are primarily located within the **CRESCENT geographic footprint** (Cascadia and adjacent regions), and
- Have been described in **peer-reviewed publications** with an associated DOI.

Both conventional and non-traditional catalogs are welcome, including those based on:
- Template matching,
- Machine learning detection and phase picking,
- Dense array or nodal deployments,
- Studies of low-frequency earthquakes, tremor, or microseismicity.

## Repository Structure

Each catalog included in the repository consists of:
1. A downloadable catalog file (e.g., CSV), and  
2. A corresponding **JupyterBook page** describing the catalog, its methods, and its scientific context.

Catalog description pages follow a standardized Markdown format to ensure clarity and consistency while allowing contributors to highlight the unique aspects of their work.

## Visualization

Catalogs hosted in this repository are integrated into the **CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Viewer**, enabling interactive exploration of seismicity patterns across space and time. The viewer is intended as a discovery and comparison tool and does not replace citation of the original peer-reviewed publications.

## Authorship and Governance

The CRESCENT Earthquake Catalog Repository is developed and maintained by the CRESCENT cyberinfrastructure team in collaboration with the broader Cascadia earthquake science community. Individual catalogs remain the intellectual property of their original authors.
