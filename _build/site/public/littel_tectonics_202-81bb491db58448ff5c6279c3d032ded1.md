## Overview

This catalog accompanies **Littel et al. (2024)** and provides a high-resolution earthquake relocation dataset for the **Queen Charlotte Triple Junction (QCTJ)** region. The catalog improves earthquake hypocenter locations using relative relocation techniques, enabling more detailed analysis of fault geometry, seismicity patterns, and tectonic processes at the transition between the Pacific–North America plate boundary systems.

The relocated events illuminate fine-scale seismic structure in a complex tectonic setting that includes strike-slip faulting, subduction, and transform motion.
