Map of northern Vancouver Island and the Nootka Fault zone region. (a) Relocated earthquakes and anthropogenic events are displayed as black dots and magenta dots, respectively. The green shaded region encloses the interpreted extent of the NFZ. Stations are plotted as inverted red triangles and profiles BB’ through GG' as orange lines. Hypocenter and CMT solutions for the 2004, 2011, and 2014 Mw > 6 events are displayed as the enlarged circles and diamonds, respectively. (b) Zoomed map of the offshore NFZ with relocated earthquake hypocenters colored by depth. Conjugate fault “E3” as defined by Hutchinson et al. (2019) is labeled and the Mw > 6 events are identified as stars.

## Abstract

The Queen Charlotte triple junction/Explorer microplate region offshore British Columbia, Canada, is marked by poorly understood and rapidly evolving microplate tectonics. Although the region hosts abundant seismicity, it has received relatively scant attention in recent years due to its remote, offshore location. We use the Regressive ESTimator (REST) algorithm to generate a new catalog of automatically detected earthquakes from 1995 to 2021, which, when merged with the existing Geological Survey of Canada catalog, yields the most extensive seismicity data set offshore British Columbia to date. We apply double-difference relocation to these events and perform stress inversions using moment tensors for subregions within the study area. Our results confirm and extend previous models of microplate deformation processes. We suggest the Revere-Dellwood-Queen Charlotte fault system has evolved as a NW-migrating, pull-apart system between Haida Gwaii and the Explorer ridge that obeys global length/width scaling and whose bathymetric expression is influenced by volcanism plausibly induced by interaction with the Kodiak-Bowie hotspot. Seismicity within the Explorer microplate is dominated by prominent, northeast-trending lineations that emanate from the Sovanco fracture zone and parallel the Nootka fault zone. Alignment of these features with spreading structures that bound the microplate suggests that its breakup is controlled primarily by a strength fabric inherited at spreading ridges. Stress inversions are dominated by near-vertical intermediate compressive stress reflecting the dominance of strike-slip faulting. Stress varies systematically between transpression to the north along southern Haida Gwaii and seafloor spreading to the south along the Juan de Fuca ridge.
